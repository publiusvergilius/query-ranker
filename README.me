# RankerQuery
## Priority Queue Based on Query Access Frequency
The `RankerQuery` is a custom priority queue designed to manage and rank queries based on their access frequency. This is especially useful in systems like **caching**, where it's important to prioritize the most accessed queries to optimize performance.

### Use Case:
- **Caching the Most Accessed Queries**: In scenarios where frequently accessed queries need to be prioritized, a priority queue can help ensure that the most popular queries are handled first.
- **Efficient Query Ranking**: As queries are accessed, their ranking can be adjusted dynamically to reflect their popularity.

# **Problems Encountered and Potential Solutions**

## Problem 1: **Inefficient Access to Queries in a Priority Queue**
In the current implementation, queries are stored in a priority queue, and accessing them is an O(log n) operation. However, querying for the most accessed item might not always be efficient enough if queries are updated frequently.

### Proposed Solution:
- **Optimized Access with a Map**: Instead of directly modifying the priority queue after every access, you can maintain a **map** that stores the count of accesses. After a certain **stale time**, you can push the list of queries from the map into the priority queue.
    - **Why this is better**: This solution would reduce the need to adjust the heap on every query access, as you increment counts in constant time (`O(1)`) within the map, and only push updates to the priority queue in batches.
    - **Implementation Idea**:
      1. Use a map to track query access counts.
      2. After a defined period of time (stale time), push the queries from the map into the priority queue.

# **Steps to Improve Performance**

### 1. Use a Map to Track Query Access Frequency
Instead of immediately modifying the heap when a query is accessed, we can store queries in a map where the key is the query string and the value is the access count.

- **Map Structure**:
    ```go
    queryMap := make(map[string]int)
    queryMap[query]++  // Increment the count on every access
    ```

- **Why It Helps**: 
    - By using a map, you minimize the time complexity to O(1) for accessing and updating the count of each query.
    - This prevents the overhead of constantly reorganizing the heap.

### 2. Push Queries to the Priority Queue After Stale Time
Once queries have been accessed a sufficient number of times (or after a certain stale period), you can transfer the data from the map to the priority queue in bulk.

- **Stale Time Handling**:
    - A timer or cron job could periodically trigger the pushing of queries from the map to the priority queue.
    - After pushing, you can clear the map to restart the counting process for a new period.

### 3. Priority Queue with Log(n) Access
Once queries are in the priority queue, accessing the most frequent queries
